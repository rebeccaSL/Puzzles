            <p>A code is a mapping from something meaningful (the message you want to communicate) into something else, usually something shorter. It requires a codebook to break.</p>
            <p>A cipher is a mechanical algorithm that works on individual letters (sometimes longer strings) and transforms each piece into something else. <a href="ciphers.html">Click here</a> to visit the Ciphers page to learn about some ciphers.</p>
